# CIS322 Final Project - MeetMe
uses mLab, Flask, jQuery, Bootstrap, and FullCalendar

intended usage: visit index of website, specify date and time range, send /schedule/xxxxxxxxxxx url to colleagues, have them log in and select their busy calendars which in turn edits the free times

unfortunately I could not get logging out working, so you have to use a different browser (delete cookies) or computer to use a different google account

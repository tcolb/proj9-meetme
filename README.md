# CIS322 Final Project - MeetMe
Uses mLab, flask, jQuery, bootstrap, and fullCalendar

intended usage: visit index of website, specify date and time range, send /schedule/xxxxxxxxxxx url to colleagues, have them log in and select their busy calendars which in turn edits the free times

unfortunately I could not get logging out working, so you have to use a different browser (or delete cookies) or computer to use a different google account
